New in 1.4.2

Windows:

- Added a new setting (General -> Optional Features) that allows enabling or disabling the OS theme.
	- When enabled, GBM will match the OS theme (Light or Dark mode).
	- When disabled, GBM will always use the classic color scheme (Light mode).
	- The OS theme is enabled by default as this behavior matches prior versions.
	- Changing this setting requires restarting the application.
	- This setting is not available in Linux.
- Updated 7-Zip to 25.00.
- Updated SQLite to 3.50.2

General:

- Changed the error message to be more descriptive when a required system path can't be set on start-up.
