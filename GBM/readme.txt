Important Notice:

Game Backup Monitor will no longer be receiving any major new features or changes.  However I will continue to maintain it and apply minor changes or fixes as required.  

I'd like to thank everyone that made contributions to this project over the years!

New in 1.3.5

All Platforms:

- Fixed an issue that prevented GBM from properly reloading the main window after the database file is updated by another application, such as Dropbox.

Windows:

- Added a toggle to control deleting files to the Recycling Bin.
	- This is enabled by default to match functionality of prior versions.
