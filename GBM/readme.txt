New in 1.4.0

Windows:

- Installers now detect and close GBM automatically if it's running.
- Installers will no longer look blurry with High DPI scaling.
- Installers now automatically set the optimal High DPI compatability mode for GBM on Windows 10 or later.
    - This prevents GBM from looking blurry with High DPI scaling.
    - This can be modified in the compatability settings for GBM.exe if another scaling mode is preferred.
- Updated 7-Zip to 24.08.
