New in 1.4.0

Windows:

- Installer and Uninstaller now detect and close GBM automatically if it's running.
- Installer now automatically sets the optimal High DPI compatability mode for GBM on Windows 10 or later.
    - This can still be changed in the GBM.exe compatability settings if another scaling mode is preferred.
- Updated 7-Zip to 24.08.
