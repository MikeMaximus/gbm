New in 1.3.6

All Platforms:

- Fixed issues that could cause the Ludusavi Manifest import to fail.
- Fixed a crash that could occur when cancelling detection and re-enabling while using the "Fast" detection speed.
- Added the ability to backup and restore saves for the currently monitored game by using the "Backup" and "Restore" buttons on the main window.
	- This allows for quick save scumming while a game is running, without interrupting the current session.
